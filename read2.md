_**Learning Markdown, Revision and the cloud!**_

> Markdown is a useful tool, it can assist novice developers and experts alike in creating content and sharing it on a dedicated webpage for free, it doesn't have as robust a library as a professional html5 utility such as repl.it but it is much more convenient and more accessible to people of various degrees of interest and knowledge in web development.

Markdown does not include an editor for its source code, it converts symbols into text features.

> I learned about the evolution of VCS systems from the Localized VCS to the CVCS, all the way up to the DVCS which we rely upon today. In order:

VCS: Version Controlled Systems, these allowed for the progressive editing and coding of a project
LVCS: Localized Version Controlled Systems, the base for from its inception to be on a local device
CVCS: Centralized Version Controlled Systems, at this stage data was stored on a single central drive to be accessed by multiple parties
DVCS: Decentralized Version Controlled Systems, the final stage, which relies on taking snapshots and storing copies of the work, while allowing for localized modification of the code before it's uploaded.
