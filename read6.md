**Design web pages with CSS**

> CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheet, it is the aesthetic element of your webpage design within which you can convey your artistic sense and create a visual experience for the viewer to engage in that will hopefully be inviting and not prohibiting for the viewer

> There are three ways mainly to add CSS features to your HTML webpage, either in-line, or in a tag, or by using a link, if you use in-line method it is easier to apply and removes the need to compartmentlize your code into containers because essentially you enter the code into the container itself and you don't need to keep count, however the HTML code becomes cumbersome to read and edit the more features you would like to add, hence we move to another method.

> Adding CCS within a tag allows for multiple features in the same container but is also less than ideal as there is a third and simpler way to go about it

> Adding CSS features through a link, and with this method, as long as you keep track of your containers, you can add whatever aesthetic features you desire, you can realign text, choose margins, colors, and anything within the code's capacity without it appearing on the HTML page more than once in a link.
