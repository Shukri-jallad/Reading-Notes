# Introductory HTML and JavaScript

> HTML's basic structure is comprised of 3 different parts, the head, main and footer, the main itself is made of as many sections as you would like, but preferrably, header, body, and footer, semantic and non-semantic tags are used to organize code, the benefit of using semantic tags lies in their ease of interpretation.

> Javascript is the dynamic element to a typical webpage, there are many different methods to accomplish relatively similar goals with Javascript, however best practice is always recommended, these functions lie in a seperate file, preferrably in a separate folder and are activated in a single tag that links the two files together.
