# HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow

> There are two kinds of lists in html, ordered lists and un-ordered lists, you typically see lists in the nav bar, but you can have them wherever you choose. The browser itself styles them for you to differentiate between the ordered and un-ordered ones, ordered ones are numbered or listed in ascending or descending order, while un-ordered usually get the bullet points.

> CSS boxes is how to properly use CSS, if it doesn't incorporate boxes, it's unelegant and messy and still is comprised of boxes, if you look keenly enough. a box is a group of commands, attributed to a parent tag, whrein you get to choose all the aesthetic attributes about a certain entity in the page or a group of lines, you list these boxes in an orderely manner to keep consistency.

> Javascript reads from one end to the other in a linear fashion, realizing this, you could evoke some useful methods to trim the code, functions for instance have the property of activating earlist, loops can be looped into each other, and as long as you trace the flow, you have a methodic way of writing code.
