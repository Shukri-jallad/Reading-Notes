# HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions

> Links are used extensively in html, they are used to link images and webpages from outside the page, as well as link files internal to the project itself, they come in their dedicated tag, it's important to note where a link is placed in the code because it activates linearly from top to bottom and it's best to keep CSS links at higher in the order, and Javascript could be placed in the footer so that the page loads first.

> CSS gives great control over the layout of the page, and it's important to keep it consistent and easy to read, some functions of CSS include stretching text, and changing position of text relatively or in an absolute sense to the frame of the page itself. It is best to comprise your code of blocks, and your idea of a page also, because that is how CSS works.

> Functions in JS play a great role, they allow the lumping together of important actions (known as functions) before the execution of the remainder of the code on a JS page, that kind of ordering of code contributes directly to the ease of read for the developer as well as a smoother execution of the code for the system itself.
