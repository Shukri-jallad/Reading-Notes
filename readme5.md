# HTML Images; CSS Color & Text

> I learned about the HTML img tag, it is an inline tag, meaning it can be displayed side by side to other inline tags, that is if we put two or three images in a single block tag they will appear side by side. Block tags appear after each other vertically

> There are different ways to specify color in CSS, RGB requires values for the three basic colors red, green and blue in decimal numbers, there is a hexagonal number system, there is also calling the color by name.

> Text size and indentation can also be changed, space between text, font, font families, and other effects such as underlining or above lining.
