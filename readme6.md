# JS Object Literals; The DOM

> I learned about functions and how to use them. Most importantly, I learned that functions can be activated after a variable, or it could take priority if it's outside a variable definition. This allows to use the function itself as an argument in other functions, such as handlers.

> I learned about DOM's, DOM's are not themselves elements, they are Object Models, they access elements through nodes, from there they're allowed to move through, delete, add text, and even add child elements.
