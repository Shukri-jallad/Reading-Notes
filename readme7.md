# HTML Tables; JS Constructor Functions

> HTML tables are created by row, they can be styled or edited by Javascript and CSS, each row is appended inside the table parent, and each cell is appended inside its respective row element. Cells can either be th: headers (with bold) or td: date (normal text)

> Object literals are these functions to which we assign many properties that are usually dynamic. Constructor functions are more useful than Object literals in that regard. We can reassign values to these functions via creating instances, or we can delete them using delete.property.

> Each of these Constructor functions or Object literals can include functions, or we can rely on their protype functions to lach onto and create multiple different functions that get their feed from the same Constructor.
