# Forms and JS Events

> Forms are important user feed/user interaction windows. The way in which forms operate is different than regular promts. They take multiple feeds of input at the same time, process them inside a function, and return important results

> Events are the arguments fed in by user input through forms, they go through their handler functions and perform tasks. It's important to note that events are capable of holding values regarding a wide array of data types in order to perform different kinds of user input.
